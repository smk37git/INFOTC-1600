Live streaming is broadcasting video over the internet. Unlike YouTube videos where you watch something recorded earlier, a live stream happens as you watch it.

## The Basics

When you stream here's what happens:

1. Your camera and mic capture video and audio
2. OBS compresses it so it can travel over the internet
3. It gets sent to Twitch/YouTube's servers
4. Those servers send it out to everyone watching

*There's usually a few seconds of delay between you doing something and viewers seeing it.*

## Streaming or Regular Videos

The big difference is interaction. When you're live, people can chat with you. You can respond to comments, answer questions, and build a presence. You can't do that with a pre-recorded video.

## Terms You'll See

**Bitrate** - How much data you're sending per second (when specifically talking about streaming bitrate). Higher bitrate equals higher quality imaging.

**Resolution** - Video dimensions like 1080p (1920x1080) or 720p (1280x720). Streams tend to be 1080p today

**FPS** - Frames per second. Usually 30 or 60. Dependent on system specs

**Latency** - The delay between you and your viewers. Can be manually set or produced from network lag

## Popular Platforms

- **Twitch** - Mostly gaming, but also art, music, chatting
- **YouTube Live** - Good if you already have a YouTube audience
- **Kick** - Newer alternative to Twitch
- **Facebook Live** - Good for reaching people you know
