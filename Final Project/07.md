This is where you build what viewers actually see.

## Creating a Scene

1. Click the + under Scenes
2. Name it something useful ("Gaming", "Chatting", etc.)
3. Click OK

You can make as many scenes as you want and switch between them while streaming.

## Adding Sources

With your scene selected, click the + under Sources. Here are the main ones:

**Display Capture** - Shows your entire monitor. Simple, but shows everything including notifications.

**Window Capture** - Shows one specific window. Better for privacy since it only captures that app.

**Game Capture** (Windows only) - Best option for games. Most efficient and works with fullscreen games.

**Video Capture Device** - Your webcam.

**Image** - Static images like logos or overlays.

**Browser** - For widgets like alerts, chat overlays, etc.

## Arranging Sources

Sources are layered. Whatever's at the top of the list appears in front.

So if you want your webcam to appear over your game:
- Game Capture at the bottom
- Webcam above it

Drag sources up/down to reorder them.

## Resizing and Moving

Click on a source in the preview to select it. Then:
- Drag the corners to resize
- Drag the middle to move it

Right-click for more options like flipping, rotating, or fitting to screen.

## A Simple Setup

For a basic gaming stream:
1. Add Game Capture or Display Capture
2. Add Video Capture Device for your webcam
3. Drag webcam to a corner and shrink it
4. Done

You can get fancier later with overlays and alerts, but this is enough to start!
