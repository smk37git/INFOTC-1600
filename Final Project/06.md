OBS looks complicated at first, but you really only need to know a few areas.

## The Layout

At the top is a big preview window - this shows what your stream will look like.

At the bottom, you've got four panels:
- **Scenes** (left) - Different layouts you can switch between
- **Sources** (middle-left) - The stuff in your current scene (camera, game, images, etc.)
- **Audio Mixer** (middle) - Volume controls
- **Controls** (right) - Start/stop streaming, settings, etc.

## Scenes

Think of scenes as presets. You might have:
- A "Starting Soon" scene with a waiting screen
- A "Gaming" scene with your game and webcam
- A "Just Chatting" scene with your webcam bigger
- A "BRB" scene for when you step away

Click a scene to switch to it. You can set up hotkeys to switch faster.

## Sources

Sources are the building blocks inside each scene. Common ones:
- Display Capture (your whole screen)
- Window Capture (one specific window)
- Video Capture Device (your webcam)
- Images
- Text

We'll set these up in the next chapter.

## Audio Mixer

Shows your mic and desktop audio levels. Green is good, red means it's too loud.

## Controls

The important buttons:
- **Start Streaming** - Go live
- **Start Recording** - Record locally
- **Settings** - Where you configure everything
