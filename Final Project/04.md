# What are CDNs?

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It's how platforms like Twitch handle millions of viewers at once.

## The Problem

Imagine if everyone watching a stream connected to one server in California. Viewers in Europe would have lag. Viewers in Asia would have more lag. And that one server would get crushed.

## The Solution

Instead of one server, platforms use hundreds of servers spread around the world. When you watch a stream, you connect to a server near you.

- Viewer in New York → connects to East Coast server
- Viewer in London → connects to European server
- Viewer in Tokyo → connects to Asian server

Everyone gets a faster, more reliable connection.

## Why This Matters to You

As a streamer, you don't really interact with CDNs directly. But it's good to know:

- Your stream goes to one place, and the CDN handles distributing it everywhere
- If a viewer complains about buffering, it might be their local server, not your stream
- Bigger platforms (Twitch, YouTube) have better CDNs than smaller ones

## Quality Options

CDNs also handle transcoding - creating different quality versions of your stream. That's why viewers can switch between 1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.

Note: On Twitch, new streamers don't always get transcoding. Your viewers might only see your original quality until you get Affiliate status.
