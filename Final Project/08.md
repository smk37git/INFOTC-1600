Bad audio will lose viewers faster than bad video. People will watch a blurry stream, but not one where they can't hear you clearly.

## Selecting Your Mic

Go to Settings → Audio. Under "Mic/Auxiliary Audio," pick your microphone from the dropdown.

## Volume Levels

Watch the audio mixer while you talk. You want:
- Peaks in the yellow/green zone
- Never hitting red (that's distortion)

If you're too quiet or loud, drag the slider under your mic.

## Basic Filters

Right-click your mic in the Audio Mixer → Filters. These help clean up your sound:

**Noise Suppression** - Reduces background noise like fans or keyboard clicks. Use "RNNoise" method.

**Noise Gate** - Mutes the mic when you're not talking. Helps with background noise, but can cut off quiet words if set wrong.

**Compressor** - Makes loud parts quieter and quiet parts louder. Gives you more consistent volume.

Start with just Noise Suppression. Add others if you need them.

## Desktop Audio

This is your game sound, music, Discord, etc. It should be quieter than your voice so viewers can hear you over the game.

A good balance: your voice peaks around -10dB, desktop audio sits around -20dB.

## Common Problems

**Echo** - Usually caused by speakers playing audio that your mic picks up. Use headphones.

**Too quiet** - Check Windows sound settings. Your mic volume might be low there too.

**Crackling** - Try a different USB port or check your cable.
