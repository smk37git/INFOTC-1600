Raw video files are massive. A minute of uncompressed 1080p video would be incredibly large.

Encoding compresses your video so it's small enough to stream while still looking good.

## What is an Encoder?

An encoder is a device or software that converts raw video frames and audio into a compressed format for real-time transmission. It takes all that data your camera and screen are producing and shrinks it down so it can actually travel over the internet.

There are different types of encoders that handle this process. Some run on your CPU, others use dedicated hardware on your GPU. The encoder you choose depends on your system specs and what you're trying to do while streaming.

## How It Works

The encoder looks at video files and finds ways to reduce the overall size:

- If a bunch of pixels are the same color, it stores "this area is blue" instead of each pixel separately. It essentially "blends" pixels

- If two frames look almost identical, it only saves what changed between them

This is why sudden scene changes or lots of motion can look worse - there's more changing, so it's harder to compress.

## Software vs Hardware Encoding

**Software (x264)** uses your CPU. It's an open-source library that converts video into the H.264 format. Because it relies on the CPU to process video frames, it performs tasks like motion estimation and rate control to achieve efficient compression. Better quality, but takes a lot of processing power. Good if you have a strong CPU and aren't playing demanding games.

**Hardware (NVENC)** uses your graphics card. NVENC is a dedicated component built into NVIDIA GPUs, designed to offload encoding from the CPU. This frees up your processor for other tasks like running games. Lower CPU usage, slightly lower quality. Only available for NVIDIA GPUs.

If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, NVENC has become industry standard lately.

## Bitrate

Bitrate is how much data you send per second. More data = better quality.

For most streams:
- 720p: around 3000-4500 Kbps
- 1080p: around 4500-6000 Kbps

Your upload speed needs to be faster than your bitrate. If you have 10 Mbps upload, don't try to stream at 8000 Kbps - you'll drop frames which in turn creates a laggy and choppy stream.

## The Tradeoff

There's always a balance between quality and what your internet/computer can handle. You'll probably need to experiment to find what works for your setup.
