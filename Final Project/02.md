Raw video files are massive. A minute of uncompressed 1080p video would be over incredibly large.

Encoding compresses your video so it's small enough to stream while still looking good.

## How It Works

The encoder looks at video files and finds ways to reduce the overall size:

- If a bunch of pixels are the same color, it stores "this area is blue" instead of each pixel separately. It essentially "blends" pixels

- If two frames look almost identical, it only saves what changed between them

This is why sudden scene changes or lots of motion can look worse - there's more changing, so it's harder to compress.

## Software vs Hardware Encoding

**Software (x264)** uses your CPU. Better quality, but takes a lot of processing power. Good if you have a strong CPU and aren't playing demanding games.

**Hardware (NVENC, etc.)** uses your graphics card. Lower CPU usage, slightly lower quality. Better for gaming since your CPU stays free for the game. Only available for NVIDIA GPUs 

If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, NVENC has become industry standard lately.

## Bitrate

Bitrate is how much data you send per second. More data = better quality.

For most streams:
- 720p: around 3000-4500 Kbps
- 1080p: around 4500-6000 Kbps

Your upload speed needs to be faster than your bitrate. If you have 10 Mbps upload, don't try to stream at 8000 Kbps - you'll drop frames which in turn creates a laggy and choppy stream.

## The Tradeoff

There's always a balance between quality and what your internet/computer can handle. You'll probably need to experiment to find what works for your setup.
