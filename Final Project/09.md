Go to Settings → Output. This is where your critical settings are!

## Output Mode

You can use "Simple" mode to start, but switch to "Advanced" once you want more control over your stream quality.

## Encoder Selection

This ties back to your hardware. OBS offers different encoder options:

**x264 (Software)** - Uses your CPU. This is an open-source encoder that converts video into the H.264 format. It relies on your CPU to handle tasks like motion estimation and rate control.

**NVENC (Hardware)** - Uses your NVIDIA GPU. This is a dedicated encoding component built into NVIDIA cards. It offloads the encoding process from your CPU, freeing it up for other tasks like gaming.

If you have an NVIDIA card, NVENC is usually the move. If you're CPU-heavy and not gaming, x264 can produce slightly better quality at lower bitrates.

## x264 Presets

The x264 encoder has presets that control quality vs CPU usage:

- ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow

Slower presets offer better quality at the cost of higher CPU usage. If you have a solid CPU with good core count and dedicated threads, you can push for slower presets. If not, stick with veryfast or faster to avoid bottlenecking your system. High CPU usage can impact performance across your entire system - programs, games, and even the encoder itself can start lagging.

## NVENC Presets

NVENC presets are more straightforward:

- Max Performance, Performance, Balanced, Quality, Max Quality

The name tells you what to expect. As newer RTX cards release, NVENC keeps getting stronger and more competitive against x264.

## Advanced NVENC Settings

NVENC offers some deeper parameters worth knowing:

**B-Frames** - These reference both preceding and succeeding frames to improve compression. Helps reduce file size while maintaining quality.

**Psycho-Visual Tuning** - Optimizes bitrate to improve image quality, especially during high-motion scenes like action games. Worth enabling if you play fast-paced content.

**Look-ahead** - Analyzes upcoming frames to make better encoding decisions. Can improve quality but adds slight delay.

**Max B-Frames** - Controls how many B-frames can be used in a row. Setting this to 2 is usually a good balance.

## Bitrate

Bitrate is the amount of data processed per second. Higher bitrate = better quality but more strain on your system and network.

Platform limits matter here:
- Twitch caps at 8000 Kbps
- YouTube allows up to 51,000 Kbps (for 4K)

Most streamers should aim for 6000-8000 Kbps. This maintains good image quality while keeping CPU/GPU usage reasonable and leaving headroom for games and other programs.

For reference:
- 720p: 3000-4500 Kbps
- 1080p: 4500-6000 Kbps

## Video Settings

Go to Settings → Video.

**Base Resolution** - Your monitor's resolution.

**Output Resolution** - What you're actually streaming at. 1920x1080 or 1280x720 are standard.

**FPS** - 30 or 60. 60 looks smoother but needs more bitrate. Dependent on your system specs.

## Testing

Before going live, hit Start Recording instead of Start Streaming. Do your thing for a few minutes, then watch the recording. Check for:
- Dropped frames
- Blurry video
- Audio sync issues

Adjust settings and test again until it looks good. Finding the right encoder settings for your hardware takes some experimenting.
