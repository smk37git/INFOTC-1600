OBS Studio is free software for streaming and recording. It's what most streamers use.

## Download

Go to [obsproject.com](https://obsproject.com) and download the version for your system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

Only download from the official site.

## Install

Run the installer and follow the prompts.

## First Launch

When you open OBS for the first time, it'll ask if you want to run the Auto-Configuration Wizard. Say yes.

The wizard will:
1. Ask if you want to optimize for streaming or recording
2. Ask your preferred resolution and frame rate
3. Let you connect your Twitch/YouTube account (or enter a stream key manually)
4. Test your internet speed and recommend settings

You can always change these settings later, so don't stress about getting it perfect.

## If Something Looks Wrong

Common first-time issues:
- **Black preview screen** - Normal until you add sources
- **OBS won't open** - Update your graphics drivers
- **Mac permissions popup** - Grant screen recording and microphone access in System Preferences
