# How Your Stream Reaches Viewers

When you click "Start Streaming" in OBS, your video takes a journey before reaching your viewers.

## You → Platform

Your stream goes to Twitch/YouTube using something called RTMP. You don't need to know the technical details - just know that when you paste your stream key into OBS, you're setting up this connection.

The stream key is like a password. It tells the platform "this stream belongs to this account." Don't share it.

## Platform → Viewers

The platform takes your stream and converts it for viewers to watch. They typically create multiple quality options (1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.) so people with slower internet can still watch.

Viewers get your stream through their browser or the Twitch/YouTube app. There's a delay of 5-30 seconds depending on settings.

## Why the Delay?

Viewers don't watch your stream in true real-time. Their device downloads a few seconds of video, then plays it while downloading the next chunk. This buffering prevents stuttering.

Some platforms have "low latency" modes that reduce delay to 2-5 seconds, but it can cause more buffering issues for viewers with slower connections.

## What You Need to Know

When you set up OBS, you'll:
1. Pick your platform (Twitch, YouTube, etc.)
2. Paste your stream key

That's it. The protocols handle themselves.
