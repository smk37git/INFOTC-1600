You've set everything up. Time to actually stream.

## Get Your Stream Key

**Twitch:** Go to dashboard.twitch.tv → Settings → Stream → copy the key

**YouTube:** Go to studio.youtube.com → Create → Go Live → copy the key

Keep this private. Anyone with your key can stream to your channel.

## Connect OBS

1. Settings → Stream
2. Pick your platform
3. Paste your stream key
4. Click OK

Or use "Connect Account" to link directly (easier for Twitch/YouTube).

## Before You Go Live

Quick checklist:
- Right scene selected?
- Audio levels good?
- Stream title/category set on the platform?
- Notifications silenced?

## Start Streaming

Click **Start Streaming**. 

Look at the bottom of OBS:
- Green square = good connection
- Yellow/red = problems (lower your bitrate)

Your stream won't appear instantly on Twitch/YouTube. Give it 10-20 seconds.

## While Streaming

Keep an eye on View → Stats. "Dropped Frames" should stay at 0%. If it climbs, your bitrate is too high or your internet is struggling.

## End Stream

Click **Stop Streaming**. Maybe switch to an "Ending" scene first if you made one.

That's it. You're a streamer now. Your first streams will be rough but you'll get better with practice!
