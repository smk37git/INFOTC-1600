# BOMBY.US WEBSITE
### - This page showcases information about my website I developed -

I decided to create **BOMBY** due to the increasingly frustrating experience of being a freelancer on other popular websites like Fiverr or UpWork to name a few. I wanted to make a platform that was more __user-friendly__, and more focused on the __user experiences__ of both the client and the seller.

I figured it would be a good idea to blend that platform with my portfolio. That way potential clients could see my work and gain that **trust** all in one place.

##### **Features of my website:**
- Complete E-Commerce Platform for multiple services
- Secure and Protected User Account Functionality
- Dynamic and Purposeful Admin Management
- Custom Graphic Design and Personality

##### **Example code snippet:**
```
    // Example code snippet
    class Product(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=8, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
        description = models.TextField(blank=True)
        is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
        
        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
```
